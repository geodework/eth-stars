# 🎨 Design Redesign Brief — Light Cyberpunk Minimalism

## 🧩 Context

The current design feels too business-like and SaaS-oriented.  
This redesign should shift to a **Cyberpunk-inspired style** while keeping the atmosphere **light, clean, and user-friendly**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create a visual identity that blends **cyberpunk aesthetics** (neon, edgy fonts, futuristic feel) with **minimalism and high usability**.  
The result should feel **futuristic, light, and approachable** — not dark or overwhelming.

## 🎨 Color Scheme

### 🧱 Background (Main UI Area)

- Use a **light grey-white tone**, such as `#F3F4F6` or `#EDEDED`
- This keeps the overall experience **bright, breathable, and non-intimidating**

### 🧱 Header & Footer Background

- Use: `rgba(15, 12, 41, 0.8)`
- A deep, semi-transparent bluish-black to create a **cyberpunk edge** in framing elements

### 💠 Primary Accent

- Use: `rgb(0, 255, 247)`
  - Bright **cyan neon** for primary highlights (buttons, links, active states)

### 💟 Secondary Accent

- Use: `rgb(255, 0, 234)`
  - Vibrant **magenta neon** for secondary highlights (tags, hover, icons)

> Accents should be **minimal** and purposeful — use them to draw attention to interactive or important elements only.

## ✍️ Typography

### 🔠 Headers & Footers

- Use **cyberpunk-style display fonts** to build futuristic character:
  - Suggested: `Orbitron`, `Audiowide`, `Exo 2`

### 🧾 Body & UI Text

- Use a **readable, slightly futuristic sans-serif font**:
  - Preferred: `Space Grotesk`

> The goal is a typographic hierarchy that feels high-tech yet remains readable.

---

## ✅ Implementation Notes

- Maintain **light theme** throughout main content areas — dark tones are **only for header and footer**
- Avoid heavy gradients, glows, or animations unless used minimally
- Ensure **high contrast** and **accessibility** across elements
- Use **clean layouts, generous spacing, and simple UI structure**

## Note

- Don't add the font via pnpm. Rather fetch it by google font api to minimize the dev speed. If it does not google font, choose different but similar one

---

## 🧠 Summary

**Design Style = Cyberpunk Energy + Light UI + Minimalism + Readability**

- Light grey interface, cyberpunk framing via header/footer
- Neon accents highlight interaction without overwhelming
- Balanced fonts: futuristic headers, friendly body
- Designed for clarity, style, and ease of use
